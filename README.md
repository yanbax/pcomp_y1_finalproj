# pcomp_y1_finalproj

All work elements for Year 1 BSc Physical Computing Final Project

You can read more about the core project idea in the file PROJECT PROPOSAL

Full documentation of my process, fabrication & design ideas can be found on my project blog at https://yanbax.wordpress.com/category/pcomp/y1-project/?order=asc

Details of my hookup, as drawn out by me, are shown in the scan saved as HOOKUP

File 'draft sketches' contains several Arduino sketches which show iterative coding; each part (e.g. displaying text, reading from sensors) was first built as a standalone sub and later combined into the final code. These are each fully commented to explain their purposes. This includes several bug fix tests. These will be referenced and fully contextualised in the project blog.

The final code is saved as PROJECT FINAL
